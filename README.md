* This website has been designed to represent an insight into my javascript knowledge so far. Javascript was by far the hardest challenge I have experienced so far on the course. 

* This website may also interest anyone looking to bring some organisation to their life.

## User Experience (UX):

User Stories
First Time Visitor Goals
* 
* As a First Time Visitor, I want the user to understand the purpose of the webpage is to create a todo list for daily or weekly tasks.
* As a First Time Visitor, I want to navigate easily around the website and input whatever tasks they have.
Returning Visitor Goals
* As a Returning Visitor, I would like the user to mark off or delete things from the list.
* As a Frequent User, I would like users to be able to regularly interract with the list and .

## Design:

Colour Scheme
The colour scheme of the webpage is:


* #EEE9DA;
* #444;
* #93BFCF
* #3C84AB
* rgb(179, 131, 226)
* #d5d5d5
* rgb(179, 131, 226)
* #e5e5e5

### Typography
* The website uses the font of 'Raleway' and the font of sans-serif is used as backup font in case of any difficulty to present the primary font of Raleway.


## Home page:
* The home page contains a simple todo list with functionality to add, mark and delete completed or unwanted tasks.

## Issues incurred:

* This is my first attempt at making a website with java script integrated and it has been an extremely difficult challenge for me to overcome. 

I had issues with the scaling on the smaller size screens (950px) and below.

## Features to implement in the future:

* I would like to implement more functionality, possibly a multi list option that you can click and drag different lists so the user may have for example shopping list and a daily tasks list on the same page.


## Programming Languages

* [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)

* [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

* [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

## Frameworks and libraries

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
* I used Google Fonts to import the font 'Raleway' to my style.css which was used all throughout the website.
* [htmlcolorcodes](https://colorhunt.co/)
* I used Colorhunt to provide a colour scheme for the website and for UX purposes.
* [Am I responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://craigmcguirk.github.io/Vilnius-Lithuania/index.html)
* I used this to create my Mockup at the top of my README.md
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* I used Git for version control. It was through the terminal; Gitpod, that I used to commit and push code to GitHub.
* [Github](https://github.com/)
* GitHub was used to store projects pushed from Git.

## Testing:

* I validated my webpage with the use of the W3C Markup Validator, jshint and the W3C CSS Validator to ensure there were no syntax errors.

## Known Bugs:

I am aware that there are some issues with the text box where the list does not expand as it does on larger screen sizes on screens below 350px, as a result the list is noit as user friendly as I would like it to be.
