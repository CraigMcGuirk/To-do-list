* This website has been designed to represent an insight into my javascript knowledge so far. Javascript was by far the hardest challenge I have experienced so far on the course. 

* This website may also interest anyone looking to bring some organisation to their life.

## User Experience (UX):

User Stories
First Time Visitor Goals
* 
* As a First Time Visitor, I want the user to understand the purpose of the webpage is to create a todo list for daily or weekly tasks.
* As a First Time Visitor, I want to navigate easily around the website and input whatever tasks they have.
Returning Visitor Goals
* As a Returning Visitor, I would like the user to mark off or delete things from the list.
* As a Frequent User, I would like users to be able to regularly interract with the list and .

## Design:

Colour Scheme
The colour scheme of the webpage is:


* #EEE9DA;
* #444;
* #93BFCF
* #3C84AB
* rgb(179, 131, 226)
* #d5d5d5
* rgb(179, 131, 226)
* #e5e5e5

### Typography
* The website uses the font of 'Raleway' and the font of sans-serif is used as backup font in case of any difficulty to present the primary font of Raleway.


## Home page:
* The home page contains a simple todo list with functionality to add, mark and delete completed or unwanted tasks.

## Issues incurred:

* This is my first attempt at making a website with java script integrated and it has been an extremely difficult challenge for me to overcome. 

I had issues with the scaling on the smaller size screens (950px) and below.

## Features to implement in the future:

* I would like to implement mor functionality, possibly a multi list option that you can click and drag different lists so the user may have for example shopping list and a daily tasks list on the same page.


## Programming Languages
* [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)

* [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

## Frameworks and libraries

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
* I used Google Fonts to import the font 'Raleway' to my style.css which was used all throughout the website.
* [htmlcolorcodes](https://colorhunt.co/)
* I used Colorhunt to provide a colour scheme for the website and for UX purposes.
* [Am I responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://craigmcguirk.github.io/Vilnius-Lithuania/index.html)
* I used this to create my Mockup at the top of my README.md
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* I used Git for version control. It was through the terminal; Gitpod, that I used to commit and push code to GitHub.
* [Github](https://github.com/)
* GitHub was used to store projects pushed from Git.

## Testing:

* I validated my webpage with the use of the W3C Markup Validator and the W3C CSS Validator to ensure there were no syntax errors.

[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator#errors)

* I am aware there is a single error but I cannot figure out how to fix it, I cannot locate where the parse error is located

## Testing of User Stories in UX section:
* First Time Visitor Goals

## As a First Time Visitor, I want the user to understand the purpose of the webpage and learn about Vilnius through the information provided on the pages.

* On first view of the website, the user is met with a clear and concise navigation bar which takes them to the page of their choice.
As a First Time Visitor, I want to navigate easily around the website to find content.

* The navigation bar shows clear options in which section to go on the page. I implemented a fixed-top navigation bar which is very helpful for the user moving to another page on the site..

* At the bottom of the page, the user can view different social media accounts. The links take the user to a new tab, keeping my website open on the previous tab.

## Further Testing
* I have tested this website on the following browsers:

* Google Chrome
* Microsoft Edge

## I have tested my website on the following:

* iPhone X
* iPhone 7
* iPad
* iPad Mini
* Huawei P Smart
* Huawei P30 Lite
* Samsung Laptop


* I asked Friends and Family to borrow their phone or tablet to view my website in order to test the site. I also asked for feedback and if they were able to point out any bugs or UX issues.

I tested all internal links and they worked correctly.

All external links were tested and they opened on a new tab correctly.

## Fixed Bugs: 
Menu items were not displaying correctly on smaller screen sizes, I made the font size of the page title smaller in order to give the menu items more breathing space.

## Known Bugs:

I am aware that there are some issues with text clipping into the side of the screen on screens below 350px, as a result the cover text would become slightly obscured.
